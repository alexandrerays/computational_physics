# Data Structures

* Review of concepts in the context of the new programming language: functions, parameter passage, arrays, files, registers, strings, dynamic structures (pointers), and recursion. 
* Presentation of classical data structures, as follows. Linear lists: simple and doubly linked dynamic lists, circular lists. Stacks and queues. Applications. Sparse matrix. Non-linear lists: trees and binary trees. Tree representation. Search trees and balanced trees. Algorithm development for binary trees. Non-binary trees: B-trees. Algorithms and applications for B-trees. Graphs: concepts and applications. Data structures for graph representation and classical algorithms. Open and closed hashing, collision resolution.
